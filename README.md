# 32-Bit MIPS Processor in VHDL

## Overview
This repository contains VHDL code for a 32-bit MIPS processor, an extension and modification of a design originally sourced from FPGA4Student. The original design has been significantly enhanced to support a 32-bit architecture, expanded memory capacities, and additional instructions to increase its capabilities.

## Features
- **Processor Width:** 32-bit architecture to handle more extensive computations and data types.
- **Data Memory:** Expanded to 32 kilobytes, allowing for larger data storage and manipulation.
- **Instruction Memory:** Increased to 16 kilobytes, enabling more complex and longer sequences of instructions.
- **Register File:** Enlarged to include 32 registers, improving the processor's efficiency and speed by facilitating more in-register computations.
- **Additional Instructions:** New instructions have been added to extend the processor's functionality and compatibility with more complex operations.

## Modifications from the Original Design
The codebase started from a project hosted on [FPGA4Student](https://www.fpga4student.com/2017/09/vhdl-code-for-mips-processor.html), originally designed for educational purposes. The modifications include transitioning the design to a 32-bit processor, expanding the data and instruction memory capacities, enlarging the register file, and integrating new instructions to broaden the processor's operational scope.
